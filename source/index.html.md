# Introduction

This is the OpenCord API Documentation! We strive for documenting everything Discord isn't documenting in
their [official docs](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-api-docs).

All of our [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/opencordapp/docs) and we <3 corrections and improvements!

Just for your interest, we're not copying documentation from [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/).
Take this page as a supplement to the official docs. If something isn't stated here, that means all the important
aspects of this topic are already documented well enough.

# Getting Help

If you think you're experiencing a bug with our API or would like to report incorrect documentation, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/opencordapp/docs/issues) for it on GitHub.

Please note that any contents you cannot find in the official API docs aren't supposed to be publicly exposed.
Neither the people over at Discord API, nor the people at OpenCord are going to help you if you're stuck with integrating
anything from here into your applications as you shouldn't actually do that.

Discord doesn't really care if you're wrangling undocumented stuff (like voice receive) into working - but don't expect
any assistance and stuff may break at any time. You have been warned.
