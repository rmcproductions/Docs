# OpenCord API documentation

As OpenCord reimplements the Discord API, you could see this as an alternative Discord API documentation with additional,
undocumented stuff. Please refrain from annoying the people on the Discord API guild with stuff you've read here.
You won't receive support and shouldn't use it in your applications if it can't be found in the official documentation
[over here](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-api-docs).
